# #tidytuesday Week 47: NZ Bird of the year 2019
Hi everyone! This is my first post about #tidytuesday, thank you @alexvbr22082018 for showing me this awesome community.

I believe my solution is about readability and simplicity, so I use `data.table`. Hope anyone could suggest improvement or criticism about the code and the idea.
